# Bunker Blitz
Codebase for the top-down tank game developed throughout Spring, 2023 as the final project for the senior capstone class. Developed by a group of 5 in C++ with QT handling the UI, the game features enemy AI behavior, various power-ups, custom artwork, and a final boss tank that must be defeated in order to win the game. A .zip file with the finished game can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17cdpjHa6B0cADxLBEbk9fcBCZt1wQijL/view?usp=sharing).
